			<name>Ragu</name>
			<desc>A classic pasta with meat sauce. Easy to make and very broadly appealing, it's the perfect dish for a family dinner. Store-bought pasta sauce works just fine here, but you can make your own if you want to go the extra mile.
			Tips:
			Add milk, parmesan cheese, and/or white wine vinegar to the sauce to improve flavor</desc>

			<name>Fried Rice</name>
			<desc>A very versatile dish that you can make from nearly anything. Just sautee your choice of proteins and veggies and add rice, soy sauce, and scrambled egg.
			Tips:
			If adding chicken, go for chicken thighs as opposed to breast meat. Breast meat is more expensive and too dry for this style of cuisine.
			Prepare the rice a day before cooking and let it dry out in the fridge. Fried rice is traditionally prepared as a way to salvage stale rice, and actually tastes better that way!</desc>

			<name>Roast Potatoes</name>
			<desc>A great side dish for any meal, but especially when there is a meaty main course. Leftovers also go great with eggs and cheese for breakfast. Chop your potatoes, roll them in oil and salt, then bake at high heat until they look golden!
			Tips:
			For crunchier potatoes, boil them briefly before baking, just enough that the surface starts to be mushy. You can even just microwave them if you're in a rush.
			Add garlic and herbs toward the end of the baking time to improve the flavor. Adding them too early will just cause them to burn.</desc>

			<name>Omelette</name>
			<desc>A hearty breakfast that takes very little time to prepare.
			Tips:
			When adding cheese to an omelette, do it at the very end. If cheese is left to sit in heat for too long it will start to turn oily.

			<name>Sandwich</name>
			<desc>Vegetables, cheese, and meat, normally with a condiment, but you can really put whatever you want as long as it is between two slices of bread. Get as creative as you want and mix and match the ingredients to make something to your liking!
				Great for left over meat!
